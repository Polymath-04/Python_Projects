## Walmart Sales Forecasting Project

This project aims to develop accurate weekly sales forecasts for Walmart stores using historical sales data and relevant external factors. The analysis and modeling are documented in the Jupyter notebook `wallmart project report.ipynb`, with supporting data in `wallmart dataset.csv` and a detailed summary in `wallmart project report.pdf`.

**Project Overview**

Walmart, as a major retail chain with multiple outlets across the country, faces challenges in aligning inventory with demand. Ineffective inventory management can lead to overstocking (increased costs, unsold goods) or understocking (lost sales, customer dissatisfaction). This project addresses these issues by building predictive models to forecast weekly sales, enabling better inventory planning and operational efficiency.

---

**Objectives**

- Predict weekly sales for Walmart stores using historical and external data.
- Identify key factors influencing sales, such as holidays, weather, and economic indicators.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize inventory management and reduce operational costs.

**Dataset**

- **File:** `wallmart dataset.csv`
- **Size:** 6,435 rows Ã— 8 columns
- **Features:**
  - `Store`: Store number
  - `Date`: Week of sales
  - `Weekly_Sales`: Sales for the given store in that week
  - `Holiday_Flag`: Indicates if it is a holiday week
  - `Temperature`: Regional temperature
  - `Fuel_Price`: Regional fuel cost
  - `CPI`: Consumer Price Index
  - `Unemployment`: Regional unemployment rate

The data spans from 2010 to 2012, covering multiple stores and capturing both internal and external factors affecting sales.

**Methodology**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Trends in weekly sales, seasonality, and effects of holidays and economic factors were explored.
  - Feature engineering included extracting temporal features and categorizing continuous variables for simplified analysis.

- **Modeling Approaches:**
  - **Time Series Models:** ARIMA and SARIMA were used to capture trends and seasonality in sales data.
  - **Regression Models:** Linear regression explored relationships between sales and external features.
  - **Model Evaluation:** Performance was assessed using RMSE and MAE, comparing different models to select the best predictor.

---

**Key Findings**

- Holidays and seasonal cycles are major drivers of sales spikes.
- Economic factors like fuel price and temperature also influence weekly sales, though to a lesser extent.
- Time series models (ARIMA/SARIMA) and linear regression provided the most accurate forecasts, with time-based features and holiday flags being especially important.
